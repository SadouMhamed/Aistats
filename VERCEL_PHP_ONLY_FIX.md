# ðŸ”§ **PHP-Only Deployment Fix**

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Identified:**

```
vercel-build.sh: line 20: composer: command not found
vercel-build.sh: line 33: php: command not found
```

**Root Cause**: Vercel detected `package.json` and ran build in Node.js environment, but PHP/Composer aren't available there.

## âœ… **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Excluded Node.js Files from Deployment**

Added to `.vercelignore`:

```
package.json
package-lock.json
```

### **2. Simplified vercel.json for PHP-Only**

```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
        {
            "src": "api/index.php",
            "use": "vercel-php@0.6.0"
        }
    ]
}
```

### **3. Pre-built Assets Already Committed**

```
âœ“ public/build/assets/app-Dq_idYs2.css (52KB)
âœ“ public/build/assets/app-DaBYqt0m.js (79KB)
âœ“ public/build/manifest.json
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Deployment Process:**

1. **Vercel detects**: PHP project (no package.json)
2. **Runtime environment**: PHP with Composer available âœ…
3. **Build assets**: Pre-built, served as static files âœ…
4. **Laravel setup**: PHP commands work correctly âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ **No Dashboard Changes Needed**

The deployment should now work automatically with:

-   âœ… **Framework**: Auto-detected as PHP
-   âœ… **Build Command**: None (pure PHP runtime)
-   âœ… **Output Directory**: None (serverless functions)

## ðŸ§ª **Test This Fix:**

1. **Redeploy** from Vercel dashboard
2. **Check build logs** - should see PHP environment
3. **Verify**: No "composer: command not found" errors
4. **Confirm**: Frontend assets load correctly

## ðŸ”„ **For Future Frontend Changes:**

### **Local Development:**

```bash
# package.json is still available locally
npm install
npm run build
git add public/build/
git commit -m "Update frontend assets"
git push
```

### **Deployment:**

-   Package.json ignored by Vercel âœ…
-   Pre-built assets deployed âœ…
-   Pure PHP environment âœ…

## ðŸŽ‰ **Expected Success:**

```
âœ“ PHP runtime environment loaded
âœ“ Composer dependencies installed
âœ“ Laravel configuration cached
âœ“ Frontend assets served
âœ“ Deployment successful
```

This approach gives you the best of both worlds:

-   **Local development**: Full Node.js + PHP environment
-   **Production deployment**: Optimized PHP-only with pre-built assets

Your deployment should now work perfectly! ðŸš€
